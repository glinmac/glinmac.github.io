My name is Guillaume<sup>*</sup> Gardey and I'm an independent software engineer specialized in Big Data.
I have been working at all levels of the stack from architecture, engineering, analytics, BI, ... to clusters deployment, 
platform management, security and infrastructure.

I've been helping companies to analyze, shape and implement end to end solutions for their different data related 
products and challenges and have been working in different sector of industries: research, media, gaming, finance and government.
